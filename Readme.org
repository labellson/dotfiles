This are my dotfiles. I am using =stow= and some bash scripting to manage
them. 

Some of the bash scripts requires =root= privileges as it creates some system
files. A *warning* will appear if the script ask for root privileges. With your
confirmation to proceed, =sudo= will prompt for your password.
